""" Module: content as part of: organize

    Created by: Reinier on 16-8-2017. Collected data comes in a variety of formats. Data should be organized in a
    structured manner to achieve a better usability of available data like movies, series, pictures, documents, etc.
    also known as media-type.

    All gathered data by means of: mail, download, etc. is temporarily saved in a predefined location.
    Data is undefined which means that object-names are raw and relevance isn’t added.

    Examples:
        Should be defined in a later state.

    TODO:
        - Use TODO comments for code that is temporary, a short-term solution, or good-enough but not perfect.

    As an aspect of organizing data gathering information of an object is essential. Information that should be
    gathered is a pattern and title and/or name. If this information can’t be gathered, manual selection via a
    user interface should be possible.

    Raw data can consists of several files, based on the media type a object size criteria is essential. In addition
    supporting file should be kept and can be defined as exception files(subtitles).

    The title and pattern will then be used to create the final location and file of folder object, relevant object.
    I.e. For series a id is given like: S##E## based on it a (sub)folder like: “Season_##” is created.

    A new object name in relation to a predefined name pattern following a naming convention is made.
